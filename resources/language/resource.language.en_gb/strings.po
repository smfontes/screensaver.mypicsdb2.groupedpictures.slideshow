msgctxt "Addon Description"
msgid "The screensaver uses the database created by the [I]My Pictures Database[/I] addon to show groups of pictures that were all taken on the same date. A date is chosen at random, then pictures from the chosen date are displayed, ordered by time taken. After some number of pictures are displayed, the next random date is chosen. This allows you to see random selections from your picture collection, but within the context of other pictures from the same event. Filters created in the [I]My Pictures Database[/I] addon can be used to select the first picture in each group of pictures."
